Okay, so just got out of watching Phule and OMG, what a ride! Seriously, I went in thinking it was just gonna be this typical thing, y’know, and it kinda was, but also wasn’t? Like, it hit me with these feels I wasn’t ready for. Maybe 'cause I’m super tired, or maybe it’s just damn good. Man, why didn’t I download the movie sooner? Not saying you should, but you should. 😂

The visuals, tho! As an art director, of course, I was drooling over them. Pure eye candy. They nailed the colors – think Wes Anderson vibes but also not? Like they borrowed his palette, but added their own twist. Not gonna lie, kind of want to run away and remake everything I’m working on in that style right now. But then, there are some plot points that are just… like, come on, REALLY? You know what I mean.

> You ever watch something and think, “Okay but why is this even working?” That was me, literally every 10 minutes. It's like watching this beautiful chaos unfold. Actually tempted to watch the movie again just to see if it makes any more sense the second time around.

The characters had me all over the place, honestly. One moment I’m cheering for them, the next, just SMH. It’s like they wanted to keep you on your toes but, like, leave some of the toes on the floor for no reason whatsoever. 😂 But anyway, that’s what made it kinda charming, if you’re into that whole plot-doesn’t-have-to-make-sense thing.

console.log(What is even happening?);

But yeah, if you haven’t seen it, find a way to watch it. Just go with no expectations. Or every expectation. Who even knows at this point. I’m grabbing some coffee. Catch you later!
